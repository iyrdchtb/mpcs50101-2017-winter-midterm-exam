# Problem 1: Read this program and describe what the code does?
#
# You will have 10 minutes to complete this problem.  You will need to commit
# this to your repository within the given time.  After you have done your
# commit, move on to the rest of the exam.  The object of this problem is for
# you to understand what the code does without actually running it (ie. do not
# actually run this).
The code prints value of 10%2 = 0 based on values of i and j. It initializes i and j = 0 and increments then such that j is less than i and i less than 6 based on the two while loops. It prints out values for 10%2 and value of j before incrementing it. (there's print 10%2, j=j+1 in the loop.)
The outer while increments i; the inner while increments j.

Output
Nothing printed for i,j=0
