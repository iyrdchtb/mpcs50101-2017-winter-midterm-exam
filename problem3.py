# Problem 3:  How many ping pong balls can fit inside a Boeing 747 airplane?
#
# Use the following information to answer the question:
#   * The radius of a ping pong ball is .02 meters
#   * The volume of an Boeing 747 airplane is 1035 cubic meters
#   * The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)*pi*radius^3
#
# In your solution, write a function named `volume_of_sphere` that takes a
# radius as a parameter and returns the volume.  Print your final answer out.
